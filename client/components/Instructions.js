        <h3>The Code Aloud Interview Process</h3>
        <p>
          For each challenge, you will recieve a prompt. You will repeat that
          prompt back to us in your own words, create an example input and
          output for the given prompt, and pseudo-code your approach, all before
          you are directed to our code editor where you will actually code an
          example out. You can then check if your code passes the tests and/or
          run your example through the code editor. When you're finished, we
          will show you what you got correct and what you may have missed. This
          approach is a sure way to prepare you for technical interviews and
          whiteboarding exercises. Good luck!
